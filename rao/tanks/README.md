# Game of Tanks

A simple game made in vanilla Javascript as a school project.

## Gameplay

The goal is to kill as many enemy tanks as their numbers increase.

You can change your controls in settings, but the default is:

- Up: W
- Down: S
- Left: A
- Right: D
- Shoot: SPACE

The cannon follows the position of your cursor.
